## Game Logic

The game uses predefined puzzle layouts from the `levels.js` file, which contains carefully designed boards with contiguous colored regions. Each region is a different color and represents a constraint that must be considered when placing queens.

The win condition is checked by ensuring:
- No two queens are in the same row
- No two queens are in the same column  
- No two queens are on the same diagonal
- The correct number of queens are placed (one per row/column)
